[CHIEF TUI]
Moana, make way, make way
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is all you need
The dancers are practicing
They dance to an ancient song

[VILLAGERS]
Who needs a new song?
This old one's all we need

[CHIEF TUI]
This tradition is our mission
And Moana there's
So much to do
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need
We share everything we make
We joke and we
Weave our baskets
The fishermen come back
From the sea

[VILLAGERS]
Make way!
That's all you need
We make!

A ha!

[BABY MOANA]
I wanna see...

[CHIEF TUI]
Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief and
There you are

[VILLAGERS]
There you are


[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is where you are

[CHIEF TUI]
Consider the coconut

Consider its tree
We use each part
Of the coconut
That's all we need

[SINA]
We make our nets
From the fibers

The water is
Sweet inside

We use the leaves
To build fires

We cook up
The meat inside


[CHIEF TUI]
Consider the coconuts

The trunks and the leaves
[VILLAGERS]

The what?

We use each part
Of the coconut
That's all we need

We make our nets
From the fibers

The water is
Sweet inside

We use the leaves
To build fires

We cook up
The meat inside

Consider the coconuts

Ha!

[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
The island gives us what we need

[YOUNG MOANA]
And no one leaves...

[CHIEF TUI]
That's right we stay
We're safe and
We're well provided
And when we look
To the future
There you are
You'll be okay
In time you'll learn
Just as I did

[VILLAGERS]
 
There you are

[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
You must find happiness
Right where you are

[GRAMMA TALA]
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous, ha!
I like how it misbehaves
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like
Well there you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside
Is who you are

[MEN]
We make our nets
From the fibers
The water's sweet inside
We use the leaves
To build fires
To cook up
The meat inside

[CHIEF TUI]
The village believes in us

[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
The village believes
The island gives us
What we need

[CHIEF TUI]
And no one leaves

[MOANA]
So here I'll stay
My home, my
People beside me
And when I
Think of tomorrow
There we are

I'll lead the way
I'll have my people
To guide me
We'll build our
Future together

Cause every path
Leads you back to

You can find happiness right
[SINA & WOMEN]

We weave our nets
From the fibers
A real tasty treat inside
We sing the songs
In our choirs
We have mouths
To feed inside

[WOMEN]
That's right!
The island gives us
What we need

[VILLAGE]
There we are

Where we are
Where you are
Where you are
Where you are
