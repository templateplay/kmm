We Know The Way
Opetaia Foa'i


[Intro: Opetaia Foa'i]
Tatou o tagata folau e vala’auina
E le atua o le sami tele e o mai
Ia ava’e le lu’itau e lelei
Tapenapena

[Hook 1: Chorus, Opetaia Foa'i]
Aue, aue
Nuku i mua
Te manulele e tataki e
Aue, aue
Te fenua te mālie
Nae ko hakilia mo kaiga e

[Verse 1: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
We read the wind and the sky when the sun is high
We sail the length of the seas on the ocean breeze
At night, we name every star
We know where we are
We know who we are, who we are

[Hook 2: Chorus, Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Aue, aue
We set a course to find
A brand new island everywhere we roam
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

[Hook 3: Chorus, Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Aue, aue
We are explorers reading every sign
We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain
Aue, aue
Te fenua te mālie
Nae ko hakilia
We know the way
